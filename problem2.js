// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
  if (value % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
}

// O(1) as it is a mathematical/arithmetic operation. Only one or two operations is performed every time regardless of input size.
